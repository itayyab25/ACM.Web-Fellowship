// SNIPPET 1 shows output 'false' while SNIPPET 2 shows output 'true' so both shows different outputs
// Now if u ask from me which one i reccomand i will recomand:
const firstNumber = 20;
const secondNumber = 20;

const result = firstNumber === secondNumber;

console.log(result);
// Reason: The === operator, performs a strict equality comparison
