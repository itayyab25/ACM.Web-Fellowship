// The variable name should be 'someNumber' instead of 'some Number'.Variable name can not be having any space

// The 'const' keyword is used to declare constants, which means the value of the variable cannot be changed after assigning. However, in this code, the variable is being reassigned to a new value, which is not allowed while using 'const'. We remove 'const' and use 'let'.

// Statements should end with a semicolon (;) to mark the end of the statement.
// 1
let someNumber = 20;
// 2
someNumber = 50;
