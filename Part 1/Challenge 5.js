// The code provided attempts to access the element at index 3 in the myArray array. However, the array only contains elements at indices 0, 1, and 2. Trying to access an element at an index that is beyond the length of the array will result in an "undefined" value.So we will add index 3 in the given code

const myArray = [20, 30, 40];
// Adding an element at index 3
myArray[3] = 50;
console.log(myArray[3]);
// Output will be 50
